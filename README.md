Neural++

This is going to be a c++ version of the tensorflow/keras API

First order of business is going to be a simple matrix multiplication lib

Once that is implemented, a simple dense-net will be created

Along with that, some form of data pipeline will have to be created

Once that's done, arguments to accelerate with Eigen will be added and a parallel Eigen implementation will be created
